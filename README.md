# Database for Emotion Recognition from Speech in a Subject-Independent Setting

The dataset includes features extracted from two databases: RAVDESS and EMO-BAJKA. An important aspect of its structure is the division into three independent subsets: training, validation, and test. 
The split was performed in such a way that no features or utterances from individuals present in the training set appear in the test set. This design supports research on emotion classification in a subject-independent setting.
